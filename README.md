# Comparision-of-spatio-temporal-BAD-using-GEE
Overview
This project focuses on comparing the spatio-temporal distribution of burned area (BA) estimates derived from multi-annual global datasets, including MODIS (MCD64A1) and VIIRS (VNP64A1). Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), Python, and machine learning techniques, the project aims to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of burned areas across Australia. This repository provides all the necessary resources to replicate the analysis and results.
